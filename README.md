## Introduction

In the age of digital content, finding the right movie can be overwhelming. This project aims to simplify that process. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can create a system that suggests movies tailored to individual preferences. This repository includes the complete code and documentation to help you understand and implement the recommendation system.

## Project Overview

This project employs two primary techniques for generating recommendations:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**: This method recommends items based on the features of the items themselves. For movies, features may include genre, director, cast, and keywords. The system analyzes these attributes to suggest similar movies to the user.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**: This technique relies on user interactions. It identifies patterns in user behavior and preferences to recommend movies that similar users have enjoyed. This approach is effective when there is a substantial amount of user data available.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a range of technologies and libraries, including:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **Keras**: For building deep learning models.
- **TensorFlow**: As a backend for Keras.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.
- **MovieLens Dataset**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Recommender System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soro8/Recommender-System-MovieLens.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required libraries.

   ```bash
   cd Recommender-System-MovieLens
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**: The MovieLens dataset is essential for this project. You can download it from the [MovieLens website](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). Place the dataset in the `data/` directory of the project.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Start Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and run the models.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## How to Use

After setting up the project, you can start using the recommendation system:

1. **Load the Data**: The first step is to load the MovieLens dataset. The Jupyter Notebook contains code snippets for this.

2. **Choose a Recommendation Method**: You can select either content-based or collaborative filtering methods to generate recommendations.

3. **Input User Preferences**: For content-based filtering, input your preferred genres or keywords. For collaborative filtering, the system will analyze user ratings.

4. **Get Recommendations**: Run the code to receive a list of recommended movies based on your input.

5. **Evaluate the Recommendations**: Use the evaluation metrics provided in the notebook to assess the quality of the recommendations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of a recommendation system is crucial. Here are some metrics you can use:

- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of relevant items among the retrieved items.
- **Recall**: Measures the proportion of relevant items that were retrieved.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find code snippets for calculating these metrics. Use them to assess the effectiveness of your recommendations.
